# TUBES System Ontology

## Uses
The scope of the TUBES System Ontology is to explicitly define the topology of interconnected building service system and their components. As a lightweight ontology it has a strong alignment to other ontologies within the W3C community and aims to provide the means to link information at data level within the AEC industry.

A persistent URI namespace for the TUBES System Ontology (tso) will be provided by [W3ID](https://w3id.org) at <https://w3id.org/tso>.
